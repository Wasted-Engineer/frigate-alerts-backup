Frigate Alerts Backup Script

This script is a gift from ChatGPT to the Frigate community. It is provided "as is" without any guarantees. Use it at your own risk.

The script is designed to backup alerts from Frigate to ensure that important footage is safely stored and easily accessible for later retrieval.

How It Works

This script backs up your Frigate alerts manually. It doesn't run automatically, but you can trigger it manually whenever needed. The backup includes:

    Alert footage: Video files associated with frigate alerts.
    Metadata: Details about the alerts, such as timestamp, camera, and event information.

While the backup process is manual, it can easily be automated using cron or another scheduler to run at specific intervals.

I have tested it with one camera, and it works as expected.
